# DNAMLM

This is the first checkpoint project for Codeworks after 1 week of instruction. The first week was over HTML and CSS so there is no JS added into this page.

## Structure
* I put together a few basic Bootstrap navbars which I  then styled myself, created some CSS animation in the review section, made some tasteful dropshadows to multiple elements if I say so myself and added a div which spills out between 2 sections. I also used Bootstrap for the basic page structure but challenged myself to write my own CSS for the media breakpoints and the differing styles that accompanied them.

## Content
* DNAMLM is a fictional company that I created for this project and this is their fictional landing page. The gifs and video used were all free to use from giphy and pexels respectively.

## Color Theme
* The theme I created is modular so it can be changed very easily. I chose the colors I did. based off the 2014 Material Design guidlines as a primary and complementary color pallette.
